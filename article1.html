            <h1>The Invisible Battle: How Mental Health Affects High School Students</h1>
            
            <p>High school is often seen as the time for youth to be youth, for them to soak up their last years as kids before entering the adult world. This however is an idealistic view that is shattered by the reality of what millions of high school students go through every year. Their life is overshadowed by the stress of deciding their future as well as an abundance of other things.</p>
            <p><b>Pressure:</b> 
            <br> High school students go through a lot, in the form of stress. This can come in the form of academic pressure, their life at home, having to navigate the high school social structure, and many more. These three years are what decides the path their life takes. Knowing that while having to juggle the many other aspects of their life, starts to take a toll on many high school students’ mental health.</p>

            <p><b>Academic Stress:</b>
                The goal of academic oriented students, is often to get into a top University. Inorder to do that, they have ot stretch themselves thin. They go between doing extracurricular activities, volunteering, working, and on top of that maintaining competitive grades. This need to do it all can have some severe consequences such as, barely sleeping, skipping meals, and isolating themselves.
            </p>

            <p><b>Social Environment:</b>
                High school is when the social structure between students get the most complex. They start to come out of the adolescent age where friendships were short-lived and inconsequential They grow into real friendships and relationships where the feelings of heartbreak, isolation, and exclusion are more intense. This leads to the declination of their mental health.
            </p>

            <p><b>Experiencing Changes:</b>
                Teenage years are a time of change; emotional as well as physical. Figuring out their identity, navigating peer pressure as well as hormonal change can lead to issues with self-consciousness and and body image. This is just another coat of challenges to their already challenging life.
            </p>

            <p><b>Mental Health Awareness:</b>
                The stigma around mental health prevents people from talking about it. The fear of getting dismissed or or being misunderstood by their peers and adults leads to a hesitancy to seek help.
            </p>

            <p><b>How Schools can Help</b>
                Schools can try to increase awareness to mental health, and lower the stigma around it. They can do this by making a school counselor available at all times for student needs as well as making the students aware of this. Celebrating Mental Health day is also a great way to raise awareness.
            </p>

            <p><b>Conclusion:</b>
